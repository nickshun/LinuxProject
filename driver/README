Installation and Execution
--------------------------

To install compile first:

$ make

Then register an ASCII driver:

$ make register

For the latter to succeed you have to have root
privileges and not to have module called 'asciimap'.
Otherwise, you'll have to tweak the Makefile.

If you don't want debugging messages, also tweak
the Makefile.

To run the test program type:
$ ./mapdriver-test
